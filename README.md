# Consumer Complaint Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify consumer complaints into different sub-categories using text classification techniques.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of consumer complaints labeled into various categories. The text data is processed using **TF-IDF Vectorization**, and multiple machine learning models are tested to find the best classifier.

## 🔧 Installation & Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk matplotlib
```

### 🚀 How to Run
Follow these steps to run the project:
1. Open ipynb file in Jupyter Notbook
2. Run each cell
